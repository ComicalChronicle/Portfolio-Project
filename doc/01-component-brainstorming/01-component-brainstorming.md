# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Mohammad Asad
- **Dot Number**: Asad.25
- **Due Date**: 9/16 @ 12:40

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. (3 points) Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. (4 points) Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

I am still very new to software and coding but I have always been interested in
technology for as long as I can remember. I have been using a computer for the better
half of my life and I have been playing video games for even longer. I still am not
100% sure what career goals I want to achieve, but I think I will be happy with any
job that involves coding whether it be programming, game development, web development etc.
Since I have a lot of experience playing video games I think I would like to
develop some basic components that could relate to that it some way.

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
        - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
        - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: InventorySystem
  - **Description**:
    - This component models a collection of items that a character can hold in a game. It allows adding, removing, and checking the contents of the inventory. The kernel of this component provides essential functionality to manage the items, while more advanced behaviors like finding specific items or checking for duplicates can be part of the secondary interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void addItem(String item)`: Adds a given item to the inventory.
    - `String removeItem()`: Removes the most recently added item (or from the right front if it's FIFO-style).
    - `boolean isEmpty()`: Reports whether the inventory has any items.
    - `int size()`: Reports the number of items currently in the inventory.
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `boolean containsItem(String item)`: Checks if a specific item exists in the inventory.
    - `void removeItem(String item)`: Removes a specific item from the inventory, if present.
    - `void clear()`: Clears all items from the inventory.
    - `int findItemIndex(String item)`: Returns the index of the specified item in the inventory.
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, this component would be mutable. The inventory can grow, shrink, or be modified as items are added or removed.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No, this component would not rely on internal classes. It operates using simple data structures like sequences or lists to manage items.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Possibly. If I decide to categorize items, enums could be used for item types. Otherwise, no constants are required.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, removeItem(String item) can be implemented using removeItem() and iterating through the items to find the one matching the input, and then removing it.


- Component Design #2: HealthSystem
  - **Description**:
    - This component models the health of a playable character in a game. It allows managing the characterâ€™s health points (HP), which can be incremented, decremented, or reset based on in-game events such as taking damage, healing, or starting a new level. The kernel will handle basic health changes, while secondary methods provide additional functionalities like checking for a critical health status or restoring health.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void takeDamage(int damage)`: Decreases the health by the specified damage amount.
    - `void heal(int amount)`: Increases the health by the specified amount, up to the maximum health.
    - `boolean isAlive()`: Reports whether the character is alive (health > 0).
    - `int getHealth()`: Returns the current health of the character.
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `boolean isCritical()`: Reports whether the character's health is in a critical state (like below 20% of max health).
    - `void resetHealth()`: Resets the character's health to the maximum value.
    - `void setMaxHealth(int maxHealth)`: Updates the maximum health value for the character.
    - `int getMaxHealth()`: Returns the maximum health value.

  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, this component would be mutable. Health points will change frequently based on damage taken or healing received during gameplay.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No, this component doesn't rely on internal classes. It operates with simple numeric values to track health and damage.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Potentially. Constants for specific status thresholds (critical health percentage) might be useful.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, resetHealth() can be implemented using the heal() method by setting health to the maximum value. isCritical() can use getHealth() and getMaxHealth() to calculate if the current health is below a certain threshold.


- Component Design #3: LevelingSystem
  - **Description**:
    - This component models a character's progression through levels in a game. It tracks experience points (XP) and manages the transition between levels when enough XP is gained. The component allows adding XP, checking the current level, and determining how much XP is required for the next level. Kernel methods will handle XP and level progression, while secondary methods can provide more complex operations like resetting the level or modifying the XP curve.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void addExperience(int xp)`: Adds experience points to the character.
    - `int getCurrentLevel()`: Returns the current level of the character.
    - `int getExperienceToNextLevel()`: Returns the XP required to reach the next level.
    - `int getCurrentExperience()`: Returns the characterâ€™s current XP.
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void resetLevel()`: Resets the characterâ€™s level and experience to the starting values (e.g., for starting a new game or mission).
    - `boolean hasLeveledUp()`: Returns whether the character has enough XP to advance to the next level.
    - `void levelUp()`: Increases the characterâ€™s level if they have gained enough XP.
    - `void setExperienceCurve(Function<Integer, Integer> xpCurve)`: Sets a custom experience curve, adjusting how much XP is required to reach each new level.
    - `int getTotalExperience()`: Returns the total XP earned across all levels.
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, this component would be mutable since the characterâ€™s XP and level will change throughout the game as they gain experience.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - It might rely on a Function class or other internal data structures to define an XP curve, but no additional classes are necessary for basic operations.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, it could potentially use constants to define specific XP thresholds for leveling up or predefined levels (e.g., MAX_LEVEL).
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, hasLeveledUp() can use getCurrentExperience() and getExperienceToNextLevel() to determine if the XP exceeds the requirement for leveling up. Similarly, levelUp() can check if the XP threshold is met and then increment the level.

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 1 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 2 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 3 here --> component
```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
